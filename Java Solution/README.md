Java solution for the Pizza problem.

The algortihm used goes through the pizza, finds a cell with a tomato topping that is not in an allocated slice, and around it recursively
grows a slice untill it reaches the maximum number of cells in a slice. It puts these maximum slices in an array, sorts it in descending
order, and then picks the first slice that has enoguh toppings of both types and allocates it.

On a judge system made by one of my lecturers, this solution got 933922 points.
